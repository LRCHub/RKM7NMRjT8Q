Here she comes, seven suns
A burning flame
She got my love, got my head
But it's all the same

She climbed so high
I don't know why
High
On her own

And I know
She's in the air
And I don't want it to go
I can feel her love
But I don't want it to go

She got my woe, got my hand
Took the dreams right outta my head
She bought the world, I paid those bills
I took those pills, it was wind in her sails

She climbed so high
I don't know why
High
On her own

And I know
She's in the air
And I don't want it to go
I can feel her love
But I don't want it to go
